# StellarTickets — Frontend

Next.js app for [StellarTickets](https://github.com/StellarTickets) —
*Secure. Verifiable. Powered by Stellar.*

Marketing site, organizer dashboard, resale marketplace, and gate-staff
verification tool, all talking to the
[backend API](https://github.com/StellarTickets/backend), which in turn
reads and writes through the
[`ticketing`](https://github.com/StellarTickets/blockchain) Soroban contract.
This app never talks to Stellar/Soroban directly — every on-chain action goes
through the backend and a browser wallet.

## New to this stack? Start here

A plain-language glossary for anyone new to Next.js's App Router or the
Stellar-specific pieces. Skip this if you already know the stack.

| Term | What it means | Why it matters here |
|---|---|---|
| **Next.js App Router** | The `src/app/` directory convention where each folder is a route and `page.tsx` is what renders there (e.g. `src/app/marketplace/page.tsx` → `/marketplace`). | This repo is on **Next.js 16**, which has real breaking changes from older versions — see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before assuming Next 14/15 patterns apply. |
| **Server Component** | The Next.js default: a component that renders on the server and ships no JavaScript to the browser for itself. | Most pages here start as Server Components for fast initial loads; anything that needs interactivity (forms, wallet buttons) opts into a Client Component with `"use client"`. |
| **Client Component** | A component marked `"use client"` — runs in the browser, can use state/effects/browser APIs. | Required for anything touching Freighter, since signing a transaction is inherently a browser-side action. |
| **[Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/)** | A browser extension wallet for Stellar — like MetaMask, but for Stellar/Soroban. Holds the user's private key and signs transactions on request. | This app never asks a user for their private key. It asks Freighter to sign, and Freighter is the only thing that ever touches the key. |
| **XDR** | Stellar's binary transaction format. See the [blockchain repo's glossary](https://github.com/StellarTickets/blockchain#new-to-this-stack-start-here) for the full picture. | Every on-chain action here is: get unsigned XDR from the backend → Freighter signs it → send the signed XDR back. |
| **Non-custodial** | This app (and the backend behind it) never holds a private key that could move a user's funds or sign on their behalf. | See the next section — it's why every ticket action needs a wallet popup instead of just happening silently. |
| **Vitest** | A fast, Vite-based test runner, API-compatible with Jest. | `npm test` runs it; test files sit next to the code they test (`*.test.ts`/`*.test.tsx`). |
| **Tailwind CSS** | A utility-class CSS framework — styling is done with classes like `flex items-center gap-2` directly in JSX rather than separate stylesheet files. | Every component in `src/components` is styled this way; see [`docs/STYLING.md`](docs/STYLING.md). |
| **`NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix** | Any env var starting with this is inlined into the client-side JavaScript bundle at build time — i.e. it is **not secret**. | `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK*` are public by design; never put a secret behind this prefix. |

## Non-custodial wallet flow

This app never sends a private key anywhere. Every on-chain action (create
event, issue/purchase/transfer/check-in/revoke a ticket, list/cancel/buy a
resale listing) follows the same three-step pattern:

1. Ask the backend to **build** an unsigned, fee-prepared XDR transaction for
   the action (e.g. `POST /tickets/purchase`).
2. Have [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) **sign** it client-side — see
   [`src/lib/wallet.ts`](src/lib/wallet.ts), which wraps
   `@stellar/freighter-api`'s `isConnected`/`requestAccess`/`signTransaction`.
   The private key stays inside the extension the whole time.
3. Send the signed XDR back to the backend's **confirm** endpoint (e.g.
   `POST /tickets/confirm-purchase`), which relays it to Soroban RPC.

[`src/lib/onchain.ts`](src/lib/onchain.ts) wires these three steps into one
`signAndSubmit()` helper so page components don't repeat them; every page
under `src/app/dashboard`, `src/app/verify`, `src/app/marketplace`, and
`src/app/my-tickets` calls it the same way. If Freighter isn't installed or
the user rejects the signature request, the flow fails closed — nothing is
submitted.

|---|---|
| `/` | Marketing landing page — brand, mission, all 12 supported industries |
| `/about` | About the project |
| `/login`, `/register` | Auth, backed by the backend's JWT endpoints |
| `/dashboard` | Organizer: create an organization, see your organizations |
| `/dashboard/organizations/[id]` | Create events under an organization |
| `/dashboard/events/[id]` | Add ticket types, publish on-chain, issue tickets |

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥ 22 (see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc)), the
[backend](https://github.com/StellarTickets/backend) running locally (or
reachable), and the [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) browser
extension installed for any wallet-signed action.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StellarTickets/frontend.git
cd frontend

npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # point NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL at a running backend
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:3001
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Environment

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list.

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Base URL of the [backend](https://github.com/StellarTickets/backend) API |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK` | `testnet` / `futurenet` / `mainnet` — must match the backend's `STELLAR_NETWORK` and whatever network the user's Freighter wallet is set to, or signed transactions will be rejected |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | The matching network passphrase (e.g. `"Test SDF Network ; September 2015"` for testnet), used when building/verifying transactions client-side |

All three are `NEXT_PUBLIC_` — see the glossary above for what that implies.

## Testing

```bash
npm run lint        # ESLint
npx tsc --noEmit    # type-check without emitting output
npm test             # Vitest
npm run build        # production build — also catches type/build errors CI cares about
```
